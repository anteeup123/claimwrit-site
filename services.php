    <h2>How ClaimWrit Supports Attorneys—Step by Step</h2>
    <p>From intake to delivery, here's how ClaimWrit transforms case documents into litigation-ready support.</p>

    <div class="process-step">
        <h3>Step 1: Submit Your Case Files</h3>
        <p>
            Upload medical records, billing statements, and incident details
            through our secure, encrypted client-upload portal—fast, organized,
            and compliant.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
        <h3>Step 2: Personal Case Review</h3>
        <p>
            Each file receives a thorough manual review—assessing timeline
            accuracy, treatment patterns, provider types, and potential
            inconsistencies. No black-box automation.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
        <h3>Step 3: Structure Into a Clear Timeline</h3>
        <p>
            Treatment notes, radiology reports, procedures, and summaries are
            distilled into a coherent chronology—focused on the facts that matter.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
        <h3>Step 4: Billing Is Summarized</h3>
        <p>
            We provide an itemized tabulation under "Injuries &amp; Damages"
            so adjusters and opposing counsel see a crystal-clear financial overview.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
        <h3>Step 5: Demand Letter Delivered</h3>
        <p>
            You receive an editable, professionally formatted PDF—courtroom-ready
            and tailored for negotiation. It includes:
        </p>
        <ul class="demand-points">
            <li><strong>I.</strong> Facts &amp; Liability</li>
            <li><strong>II.</strong> Injuries &amp; Damages</li>
            <li><strong>III.</strong> Summary &amp; Demand</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
