  <h2>1. Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>ClaimWrit, a d/b/a of Envisage Companies, LLC</strong> (“ClaimWrit,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information you provide when you visit ClaimWrit.com or use our secure Client Upload Portal (collectively, the “Services”). This policy complies with the Florida Information Protection Act (<strong>FIPA</strong>, Fla. Stat. § 501.171) and applicable federal law. ClaimWrit is <strong>not</strong> a law firm; use of our Services does not create an attorney–client relationship.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Identifiers</strong> — name, e-mail address, phone number, firm name.</li>
    <li><strong>Client Materials</strong> — medical records, bills, accident reports, photos, and other files you voluntarily upload (“Client Materials”). These may include Protected Health Information (<strong>PHI</strong>).</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Data</strong> — IP address, browser type, and usage logs collected through essential cookies and Cloudflare analytics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Draft demand letters, settlement summaries, or other documentation you request;</li>
    <li>Create and manage a secure folder unique to your matter;</li>
    <li>Communicate about your project and issue invoices or receipts; and</li>
    <li>Maintain internal records required for tax, accounting, and compliance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We <strong>do not</strong> sell or rent your information for advertising or other unrelated purposes.</p>

  <h2>4. HIPAA-Aligned Safeguards</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>TLS 1.2 or higher protects data in transit.</li>
    <li>AES-256 encryption secures data at rest in our U.S. cloud storage.</li>
    <li>Role-based access limits files to authorized personnel.</li>
    <li>Access logs and quarterly audits monitor for unauthorized activity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    ClaimWrit retains Client Materials for <strong>three (3) years</strong> after we deliver the final work product to the engaging law firm, unless that firm instructs us in writing to delete the files sooner or preserve them for an active litigation hold. After three years, the files are permanently deleted from our systems.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Cookies &amp; Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    We use first-party session cookies to keep you logged in and Cloudflare analytics cookies to measure site performance. You may disable non-essential cookies in your browser without affecting core functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Sale or Marketing Use —</strong> We never sell or share your data for advertising or other unrelated purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers —</strong> We engage secure cloud-storage and payment vendors bound by confidentiality agreements and industry-standard encryption.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Obligations —</strong> We disclose information only when required by subpoena, court order, or applicable law, or with your firm’s written consent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Breach Notification (FIPA § 501.171)</h2>
  <p>
    If unencrypted Personal Information is breached, ClaimWrit will notify affected Florida residents <strong>without unreasonable delay and no later than 30 days</strong> after determining a breach occurred. If the breach involves <em>500 or more</em> Florida residents, we will also notify the Florida Attorney General within the same 30-day period.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Request a copy or deletion of stored Client Materials (subject to legal holds);</li>
    <li>Update or correct your contact details; and</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent to processing, which may limit our ability to deliver services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The Services are intended for adult clients and legal representatives, not for independent use by children under 13. ClaimWrit does <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect personal information directly from minors. However, we may receive information about a minor (“Child Client”) that you, as a parent, guardian, or attorney, upload for the purpose of drafting a demand letter or settlement analysis. By providing such information, you confirm that you have lawful authority to do so. If we learn that a child has submitted personal information without that authority, we will delete it promptly and notify the account holder.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Material changes will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to active clients by e-mail. Continued use of the Services after the Effective Date of a revision constitutes acceptance.
